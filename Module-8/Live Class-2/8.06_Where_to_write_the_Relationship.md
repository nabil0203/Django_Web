# Database Relationships


## To create relationships between tables in a database, we use **`Foreign keys`**. The placement of the foreign key depends on the type of relationship.

---

## 1️⃣ One-to-Many / Many-to-One
> ✅ **The foreign key goes on the MANY side**

### 🔍 Real-Life Examples:

- **1 Man takes responsibility for 100 orphans (from 1000 total)**
  - Each of the **100 kids** can easily identify their **guardian (man)**.
  - But it's hard for the **man** to identify **his 100 kids** from the total 1000.

- **1 Student, Multiple Semester Fees**
  - The foreign key should be placed on the **Semester Fee** table, referencing the **Student**.


---

## 2️⃣ One-to-One
> ✅ **The foreign key column must be `UNIQUE`**

### 🔍 Difference from One-to-Many:
This is similar to a one-to-many relationship, but the key distinction is that the foreign key must be **unique** so that each row only matches with one counterpart.


---


## 3️⃣ Many-to-Many
> ✅ Both sides have **many**, so where does the **foreign key** go?

### 🧩 Solution: Use a **Junction Table**/**Link Table**/**Middle-man Table**

- You **can't directly** place a foreign key in either of the two main tables.
- Instead, create a **third table** that holds:
  - A **foreign key** referencing **Table A**
  - A **foreign key** referencing **Table B**



### 🔍 Real-Life Examples:
- **Students ↔ Courses**
  - One student can enroll in many courses
  - One course can have many students
  - Use a `Student_Course` table with `student_id` and `course_id` as foreign keys

📌 **Conclusion**:  
Use a **middle (junction) table** to implement a Many-to-Many relationship.
