## 🔀 What is a Router in DRF?

The **Router's**  job is to: 
- Capture incoming HTTP requests
- Automatically map **`CRUD`** operations to the correct `ViewSet methods`
    - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Based on the request type, it triggers the appropriate `View`

>Think of a router as a **traffic controller** that connects URLs and ViewSets.

---

## 🧠 Why use a Router?

Without a router:
- You manually define every URL
- You manually map each URL to a view

With a router:
- URLs are created automatically
- CRUD operations work out of the box
- Cleaner, shorter, and scalable code

## 🛜 HTTP Requests Captured by Router

The router captures these HTTP methods:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

And maps them to ViewSet methods automatically.
