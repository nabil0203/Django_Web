## 🔀 What is a Router in DRF?

The **Router's**  job is to: 
- Capture incoming HTTP requests
- Automatically map **`CRUD`** operations to the correct `ViewSet methods`
    - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Based on the request type, it triggers the appropriate `View`

>Think of a router as a **traffic controller** that connects URLs and ViewSets.

## 🧠 Why use a Router?

Without a router:
- You manually define every URL
- You manually map each URL to a view

With a router:
- URLs are created automatically
- CRUD operations work out of the box
- Cleaner, shorter, and scalable code

## 🛜 HTTP Requests Captured by Router

The router captures these HTTP methods:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

And maps them to ViewSet methods automatically.

## 🔁 Request → ViewSet Method Mapping

| HTTP Method | URL Pattern       | ViewSet Method       | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|
| GET        | /books/          | list()              | Get all data |
| GET        | /books/{id}/     | retrieve()          | Get single data |
| POST       | /books/          | create()            | Create new data |
| PUT        | /books/{id}/     | update()            | Full update |
| PATCH      | /books/{id}/     | partial_update()    | Partial update |
| DELETE     | /books/{id}/     | destroy()           | Delete data |
