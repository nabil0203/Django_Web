# ▶️Rest Api

- Full Form - `Representational State Transfer API`
- The Api, that follows the REST principle is called REST API 
- The response we get from Rest Api, that comes in JSON format


## 📋Elements of REST Api


### 1️⃣ Endpoint (Resource Path)
- A specific URL that identifies the resource the client wants to access
- Endpoints should use clear, pluralized nouns.
- Keep endpoints simple and predictable
- Example:
    - **/users** ✅
    - **/getAllUsers** ❌

- Example with JSONPlaceholder (Fake Online REST API for Testing):
    - Visit → [Json Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
    - Go to Resources → /posts
    - Endpoint for all posts:
        - This shows all posts.
        ```bash
        https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
        ```
    - Endpoint for a single post (by ID):
        - Change the Url
        - This shows only the post with ID = 1.
        ```bash
            https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
        ```
