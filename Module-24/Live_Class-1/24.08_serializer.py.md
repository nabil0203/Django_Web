------

- Data from the database comes as a QuerySet
    - Basically, a list of Django model instances
- To use data in an API
    - The data coming from the database must be converted into **JSON format**
    - Because frontend or clients (React/Vue) understand JSON
- This conversion is handled by a **Serializer**

---

### ▶️Inside each app we create a file named:
- `serializer.py`


---------------------

## 📌`serializer.py`

- It is as same as `forms.py`
- Insted of **forms** we need to use **serializer**
- By using it, we can directly convert data in JSON
