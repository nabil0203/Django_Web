# ▶️`views.py`

### 🔗Documentation ---> [`Click Here`](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/)
- Django REST framework -> API Guide -> Views


-----


- We use 2 types of view in DRF
    - Class Based Views
    - Function Based Views

----- 




## 📌Funtion based view [DRF]

- Check [`views.py`](https://github.com/nabil0203/Django_Web/blob/main/Module-24/Library_Management/Library_management/books/views.py)

### **Important note**:
- We have to mention on **every view** what kind of request it will have
    - both GET, POST **/** either one of them
    - using `@api_view()` decoratator
- Example:
```py
@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])                          # this view will have both GET & POST 
def author_list_create(request):

    if request.method == 'GET':
        ''


    elif request.method == 'POST':
        ''
```

### ⏮️Previously, in the MVT projects
- When a Url was hit 
    - it hits the view
    - then renders the template
### ▶️Now, in the DRF projects
- When a Url was hit 
    - it hits the view
    - then returns a JSON
