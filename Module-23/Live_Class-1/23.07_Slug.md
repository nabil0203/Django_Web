------------------------------------
- Every object/product has a ID
- When we click on the object, We can see the details of that object by it's ID
- This ID is shown in the URL❎
    - This is not efficient❎❎❎
-----------------------------------
- Instead of **ID in URL**, we want Whole **Full Object name in the URL**
- This is where Slug is used
--------------------
### 👉 Slug 
- converts the whole object name into `lower case`
- fills the gaps with `hyphen(-)`
- Now this **string** is used in the URL
- This increases SEO optimization
