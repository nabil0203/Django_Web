## To handle a file, we need to Open it first:
### How to open?

* `open()` -method
---



example:
```python
    my_file = open("my_file.txt", "r")
```        

`open` --> method

`my_file.txt` --> file-location

`r`-- >mode

---

## Some common Modes:
1. `r` ---> read only
2. `w` ---> write only (overwrites the file if it exists or creates a new file)
3. `a` ---> append (adds content to the end of the file if it exists or creates a new file)
4. `rb` --> read only for binary file
5. `wb` --> write only for binary file (for binary files)
