## Selector Specificity (Must need to know)

If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
| Priority                      | Example                     | Description                                                           |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inline style                 | `<h1 style="color: pink;">` | Highest priority, directly applied with the style attribute           |
| Id selectors                 | `#navbar`                   | Second highest priority, identified by the unique id attribute        |
| Classes and pseudo-classes   | `.test`, `:hover`           | Third highest priority, targeted using class names                    |
| Attributes                   | `[type="text"]`             | Low priority, applies to attributes                                   |
| Elements and pseudo-elements | `h1`, `::before`, `::after` | Lowest priority, applies to HTML elements and pseudo-elements         |


## Cascading:
### If the same rule is written twice into the external style sheet, then the latest rule wins: (Je pore ashbe, tar power besi)

```css
h1 { background-color: yellow; }
h1 { background-color: red; }
