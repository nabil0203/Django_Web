# 🧠 Basic Concept

### 1️⃣ When you type `google.com` into your browser and press Enter:
- 🌐 The **browser sends a request** to the server at `google.com`.
- 📄 The **server responds** with an **HTML file**, which contains the structure and content of the web page.

---

### 2️⃣ Processing the HTML
After receiving the HTML, the browser:

- 🛠️ Breaks down the HTML into different **parts**.
- 🌲 Each part is treated as a **node** in a tree-like structure called the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.

#### 🧩 Example Nodes:
```html
<head>
  -- --
  -- --
</head>

<body>
  -- --
  -- --
</body>
```

**`🧱 Each HTML tag becomes a node.`**

🖥️ The browser reads and interprets these nodes to build and display the web page visually.

# 📘 Page Source vs Inspect Elements

## Inspect → ***View Page Source***
- 🧾 This shows the `original HTML` code sent from the server.
- ✍️ It’s the actual code that the developer wrote.

## Inspect → ***Elements***
- This is `not the actual HTML` code.
- This is the modified version that browser used to understand the page
- This shows the live DOM — the version of the page after the browser has parsed, modified, and rendered it.
- It includes any dynamic changes made by JavaScript, such as:

### 🗒️ In short:

View Source = Original HTML

Inspect Elements = Modified & Rendered Version (by the browser)
