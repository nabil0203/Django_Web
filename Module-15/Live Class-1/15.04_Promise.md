## Promises

- In JavaScript, a Promise is a way to handle **asynchronous** operations like fetching data from a server, reading a file, or waiting for a timer.
- Asynchronous means running Multiple Operation in single time.
- To Do multiple operation at one time we need to use **Promises**.




## States of a Promise
1. **Pending** - Initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
2. **Fulfilled** - The operation completed successfully (resolve was called).
3. **Rejected** - The operation failed (reject was called).
