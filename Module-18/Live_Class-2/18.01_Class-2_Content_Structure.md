# 📌 Module-18 → Class-2


## 1️⃣ Theory Concepts: `18.02` → `18.06`


## 🔹 Project Flow
- In **Class-1**, we built a **Student Management System** project.  
- That project was `zipped` and stored inside the **Class-1 folder**.  
- In **Class-2**, the **same project** is `reused` for it's contents and practice.

## 🔹 Why Zip the Project?
- To **separate Class-1 and Class-2 work** clearly.  
- Zip file keeps Class-1 as a CRUD project.
- Project folder keeps Class-2 modifications
- It Ensures that, modifications in Class-2 don’t overwrite Class-1’s progress.

## 🔹 Key Concept
- **Class-1** → `My_project.zip`  
- **Class-2** → `My_project` folder
