# 📌 This for only `Module-18` Class-2

### 1️⃣ `18.02` → `18.06` Theory concept

-----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------


## We have created a `Student Management System` in Class-1
- That project has been `zipped` and uploaded in `Class-1` folder
## Then that project has been used in Class-2 for it's class contents
- Reason behind zipping to `separate` the Class-1 and Class-2

# Main Concept:
- See the `My_project.zip` for Class-1
- See the `My_project` for Class-2 -->


# 📌 Module-18 → Class-2

### 1️⃣ Theory Coverage: `18.02` → `18.06`

-----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------

## 🔹 Project Flow
- In **Class-1**, we built a **Student Management System** project.  
- That project was **zipped** and stored inside the **Class-1 folder**.  
- In **Class-2**, the **same project** is used again for explanations and practice.

## 🔹 Why Zip the Project?
- To **separate Class-1 and Class-2 work** clearly.  
- Keeps Class-1 as a reference project.  
- Ensures modifications in Class-2 don’t overwrite Class-1’s progress.

## 🔹 Key Concept
- **Class-1 Reference** → `My_project.zip`  
- **Class-2 Working Copy** → `My_project`
