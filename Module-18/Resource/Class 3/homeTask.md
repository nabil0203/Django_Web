### Homework: Linked List Practice
#### **Instructions:**

For each problem, you should:

1.  Read the problem description carefully.
2.  Think about the algorithm and the edge cases.
3.  Write the Python code to solve the problem. You can build upon the `Node` and `SinglyLinkedList` classes from the lesson.
4.  Test your code with a few examples to make sure it works correctly.

#### **1. Find the Length of a Linked List**

Write a function `length(head)` that takes the head of a linked list and returns the number of nodes in the list.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`
*   **Output:** `4`

#### **2. Search for an Element**

Write a function `search(head, value)` that searches for a given `value` in a linked list. The function should return `True` if the value is found, and `False` otherwise.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `head` of `10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40`, `value` = `30`
*   **Output:** `True`
*   **Input:** `head` of `10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40`, `value` = `50`
*   **Output:** `False`
