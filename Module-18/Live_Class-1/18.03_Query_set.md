# Query Set

### Now that we have created `DB`, but how do we `fetch` the data from DB?
- ### We use `QuerySet` for fetch data

--------------------------------

## A QuerySet can be defined as a list containing all those objects we have created using the Django model.

- ### QuerySets helps us
    - read the data from the database
    - filter it
    - order it.
