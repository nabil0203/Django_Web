# Middleware:
- There are many middlewares in [settings.py](https://github.com/nabil0203/Django_Web/blob/cea1ec529fa9eefe209bbd5578cb546f1229613a/Module-19/Live_Class-2/My_project/student_management/student_management/settings.py#L59)
- Works as a Middle man between the user’s request and the view.
- It checks the request is valid or not before it reaches the view.
- For example:
    - used @login-required
    - Before going to password change it checks - if the user logged in or not
    - if yes → proceed to view.
    - if no → redirect to login page.
