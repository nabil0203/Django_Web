ðŸŽ¯ Project: Currency Converter CLI App

In this project, you will build a CLI-based app that takes user input and performs real-time currency conversion (using mock rates).
You must use Python OOP to create a realistic Currency Converter application.

File name: currency_converter.py

---

CurrencyConverter Class:-

- A class attribute must store all the exchange rates for various currencies.
- It should have instance attributes: amount, from_currency, and to_currency, which should be initialized through the __init__ method.
- It must include an instance method that performs the currency conversion.
- It must include a class method that updates the exchange rates.
- It must include a static method that validates whether a given currency code is valid.

---

Logger Class (Association Demonstration):-

- This should be a completely separate class.
- It must include a method named log(user, amount, result) that logs the userâ€™s conversion details.
- An object of the Logger class should not be created inside the CurrencyConverter class.
- Instead, the CurrencyConverter class should accept a Logger object as input from outside, forming an association relationship between the two classes.
