# This is only for Module-17  

- To test the virtual environment, we created a folder named **`Virtual_Environment`**.  
- Then we opened that folder's directory in **Git Bash**. (This also can be done in terminal)
- After that, we followed the steps mentioned in **`17.03`**.  
- As a result, a virtual environment named **`my_room`** was created.  
- After **activating** the environment, we can create a **Project Folder** with any name, anywhere, to work on our specific project.  

---

## Recommended Approach: ✅✅
- Firstly, create a **Project Folder** (example: `bank_management` / `hospital_management`).  
- Inside this project folder
    - create the **`virtual environment`**.
    - Then create the `main project folder` using command **`vi`** of ***17.03***. Then Run Manage Server **`vii`**.
