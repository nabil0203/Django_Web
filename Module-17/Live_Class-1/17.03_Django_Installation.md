## We have 2 ways to setup:

1. **Globally**  (in pc)🌐
2. **Virtual Environment**  (isolated for each project)📦

---
---

# `Virtual Environment Setup Steps:`

## 1️⃣ Installing Virtual Environment  
- Already installed while installing **Python**  

    - Test Your Installation ❌❌
        ```bash
        pipenv --version  
        ```

## 2️⃣ Create Folder
- Create a Main Folder using a proper name📁
- Open that folder into `git bash`👻

## 3️⃣ Naming Virtual Environment ✨ (in git bash)
```bash
python -m venv room1
```
- This will create a folder having name `room1`
- This is the **Virtual Environment** 🛡️

## 4️⃣ Activating Virtual Environment (Windows) (in git bash) ▶️
```bash
source room1/Scripts/activate
```
- activating the `room1` virtual environment⚡

## 5️⃣ Install `Django` 🚀 (in git bash)
```bash
pip install django
```
**or use** 
```
python -m pip install django
```

## 6️⃣ Create Django Project (in git bash)
```bash
django-admin startproject project_name
```
- Here, `project_name` could be anything 📂
- A folder will be created with the name of project_name.
- Inside this project folder, 2 things will be available:-
    - 📁An inner project folder with the `same name` as the project_name
    - 📄A file named ***manage.py***

---

## 7️⃣ Create Django Project-App
- Now **change the directory** to that inner project folder where `manage.py` file is available using `cd` in git bash
- Then run-
```bash
django-admin startapp app_name
```
- Here, `app_name` could be anything.
- A folder will be created having the name given of the app.
---


## 8️⃣ Run Manager server (in git bash)
- In the same directory run-
```
py manage.py runserver
```
***✅✅ Django will RUN on your PC ✅✅***

⚠️⚠️⚠️
### If you don't want change the **directory** (step-7) but instead you want to directly open the project folder in VS Code where `manage.py` file is available, follow the following steps:-
- Open the project folder in VS Code where `manage.py` file is available.  
- After opening that folder, you have to `activate the Virtual environment again` using its full path.
	 - [example: *source C:/Django_Web/Module-17/Live_Class-1/Virtual_Environment/my_room/Scripts/activate* ]
- After that run `py manage.py runserver`
