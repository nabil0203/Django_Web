## We have 2 ways to setup:

1. **Globally**  (in pc)🌐
2. **Virtual Environment**  (isolated for each project)📦

---

# `Virtual Environment Setup Steps:`

## 1️⃣ Installing Virtual Environment  
- Already installed while installing **Python**  

    - Test Your Installation ❌❌
        ```
        pipenv --version  
        ```

## 2️⃣ Create Folder
- Create a Folder using a proper name📁
- Then open that folder into VS Code🔍

## 3️⃣ Naming Virtual Environment ✨
```
python -m venv room1
```
- This will create a folder having name as **room1**
- This is the Virtual Environment 🛡️

## 4️⃣ Activating Virtual Environment (Windows) ▶️
```
source room1/Scripts/activate
```
- for only `room1`-named environment⚡

## 5️⃣ Install `Django` 🚀
```
pip install django
```

## 6️⃣ Create Django Project
```
django-admin startproject your_project_name
```
- Here, `your_project_name` could be anything 📂
- A folder will be created having the name.
- Inside that folder 2 things will be available.
    - 📁A folder with the as the same name as the project name
    - 📄A file named ***manage.py***

---

## 7️⃣ Run Manager server
- Now change the directory to that project folder where `manage.py` file is available using `cd` in terminal
- Then run-
```
py manage.py runserver
```
***✅✅ Django will RUN on your PC ✅✅***

⚠️⚠️⚠️
### If you don't want change the **directory** (step-7) but instead you want to directly open the project folder in VS Code where `manage.py` file is available, follow the following:-
- Open the project folder in VS Code where `manage.py` file is available.  
- After opening that folder, you have to `activate the Virtual environment again` using its full path.
	 - [example: *source C:/Django_Web/Module-17/Live_Class-1/Virtual_Environment/my_room/Scripts/activate* ]
- After that run `py manage.py runserver`

⚠️⚠️⚠️

## 🏗️   Create Django Project-App
```
django-admin startapp your_app_name
```
- Here, `your_app_name` could be anything.

## ❌Deactivating Virtual Environment
```
deactivate
```
