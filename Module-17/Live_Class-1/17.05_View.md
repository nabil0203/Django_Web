# View is created inside the project
- check page 148, 149


## After creating a VIEW:
- We have to add it in the `url.py`
    - this is in the internal project folder


## How to add?
- Find `url.py` file in the internal project folder.
- Scroll down and look for `urlpatterns`
- Add the `path` inside the block.
- Also import here the python file `views.py`

example:
```
# imported the views
from .views import home


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',home),                              # path we created
]
```
