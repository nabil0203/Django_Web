# Model in Django
- **A model is a Python class**
- It represents a `table in your database`.
- Each attribute of the class is a `column` in the table.

----------------------------------------

## üéØ Django models are defined inside the `models.py` file of an `app`


## 1Ô∏è‚É£`models.py`
- Create model
- we took a Blog model example

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models hereüëà

class Blog(models.Model):                                       # Blog = Table name of SQL
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)                     # "name" is a Column
    content = models.TextField()                                # "content" is a column

    def __str__(self):                                 # this shows the actual blogs that we have created --> First Blog, Second Blog
        return self.name                               # without it --> Blog object (1), Blog object (2)
```
-----------------------------------

## 2Ô∏è‚É£Run migrations:
- After Creating every models in `models.py`
- Now we have to convert that model into `Database Table`
    - To do this we have follow `2` commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

- `python manage.py makemigrations` ‚Üí **converts the class into SQL**
- `python manage.py migrate` ‚Üí **used to hit in the database**
     - we can see it in --> `my_app/migrations` folder

--------------------------------------


## 3Ô∏è‚É£Register Model in `admin.py`
- My `admin panel` doesn't know that I have created a model.
- So, I have to Register in `admin.py` of the **app**

```python
from django.contrib import admin

from . import models                            # imported by me


# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(models.Blog)                # name of the model is blog
```
After that reload the admin panel `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
