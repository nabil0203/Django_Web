## JSON:
- JavaScript Object Notation
- Simplified + Text formatted Dictionary
- A response comes against a Request
- This is done by JSON
-  Very neat and organized way to store and exchange information, especially between computers
- We need JSON primarily because it acts as a universal, lightweight, and human-readable format for data interchange between different systems

## How is JSON used in the real world????
* **Web APIs:**  
When your phone app talks to a server (like when you check the weather or browse products on an e-commerce site), they often exchange data using JSON.
* **Configuration files:**  
Many software applications use JSON to store their settings and configurations.
* **Data storage:**  
While not a full-fledged database, JSON can be used to store simple data structures in files.
