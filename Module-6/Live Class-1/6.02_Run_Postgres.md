## 1. Connect to a PostgreSQL Database:

- Open `Terminal` and run:

```bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost
```
- Then enter your `Password`  
- Hit **Enter** to access Postgres.

---
- ### If I want to connect directly to a Database:
Let's assume for this example your database is called `database_name`
```bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d database_name
```
Replace 'database_name' with the actual name of  database

---




## 2. Create new Database:

- Use **SQL** to create database or table.
- Follow the syntax carefully


---

## 3. Open `pgAdmin 4` on your desktop
- Refresh the **Server**
- Check if the newly created database or table shows or not


---

## 4. If logged out of **Terminal**:
After logging out or Closing the Terminal, if I want to switch to a specific database from within psql:  

1. **Identify your database name**: Remember the exact name of the database you created. Let's assume for this example your database is called `database_name`


2. **Use the `\c` command**: At the psql prompt, type:

```bash
\c database_name
```
Replace 'database_name' with the actual name of  database.  

3. Press **Enter**.


---
If the database exists and you have the necessary permissions, you will see a message:  

    You are now connected to database "database_name" as user "your_username".
