# 📝 TO DO — `views.py` Overview

This file contains all the main view functions for the Task Management application.
It handles **task listing, filtering, creating, deleting, updating**, and **user registration**.

---

## 📌 1. Task List View — `task_list()`

### Purpose

Displays all tasks of the logged-in user, with optional filtering by **status** and **category**.

### Key Features

* Fetches the current user's tasks:

  ```python
  task = Task.objects.filter(user=request.user)
  ```

* **Status filtering**

  * `all` → show everything
  * `completed` → show only completed
  * `pending` → show only pending

* **Category filtering**
  Shows tasks belonging to one specific category.

* Separates tasks into:

  * `completed_tasks`
  * `pending_tasks`

* Renders these tasks to the template.

## 📌 2. Task Create View — `task_create()`

### Purpose

Allows the user to create a new task.

### Key Features

* For `POST` requests:

  * Validate form

  * Assign the logged-in user to the task

    ```python
    form = form.save(commit=False)
    form.user = request.user
    form.save()
    ```

  * Redirect after successful save

* For `GET` requests:

  * Show empty form to fill in.

## 📌 3. Task Details View — `task_details()`

### Purpose

Shows full details of a specific task.

### Key Features

* Retrieves the task by:

  * Task ID
  * Logged-in user
    (prevents accessing another user's tasks)

  ```python
  task = get_object_or_404(Task, id=task_id, user=request.user)
  ```

* Sends the task object to the template.

---

## 📌 4. Task Delete View — `task_delete()`

### Purpose

Deletes a selected task.

### Key Features

* Fetches the correct task of the logged-in user

* Deletes the task

  ```python
  task.delete()
  ```

* Redirects after deletion.

## 📌 5. Mark Task as Completed — `task_mark_completed()`

### Purpose

Marks a task as completed when a user clicks a button.

### Key Features

* Fetch task belonging to the logged-in user

* Set:

  ```python
  task.is_completed = True
  task.save()
  ```

* Redirect afterwards.

## 📌 6. User Registration — `register()`

### Purpose

Handles basic user registration.

### Key Features

* Uses Django's built-in `UserCreationForm`

* Validates the form

* Saves the new user

* Authenticates and logs the user in

  ```python
  user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
  login(request, user)
  ```

* Redirects after successful registration
