# ▶️Verbose Name:

## Why we need it?
- In the `models.py` we created a Model named `Category` 
- We registered it on the Admin
- When we go to the admin panel, we see `Categorys` ❌❌❌
    - Django just adds `s` to make plural
    - Because it will have multiple objects
- But This is not Grammatically correct


----------------------------------------------


## To solve this we use **Verbose** name
- add the following in Category Model
```py
class Category(models.Model):
#   .............................. 
#   .............................. 

    class Meta:
        verbose_name_plural = "Categories"            # Correctly handles irregular plurals
```
